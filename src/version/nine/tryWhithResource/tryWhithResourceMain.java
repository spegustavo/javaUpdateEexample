		 * changed after it is initialized.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * A final resource final Resource resource1 = new Resource("resource1"); An
		 * effectively final resource Resource resource2 = new Resource("resource2");
		 * 
		 * 
		 * In Java SE 7 or 8, you would declare new variables, like this:
		 * 
		 * try (Resource r1 = resource1; 
		 * Resource r2 = resource2) { ... } 
		 * 
		 * In Java SE 9, you donâ€™t need to declare r1 and r2:
		 * 
		 * // New and improved try-with-resources statement in Java SE 9 
		 * try (resource1;
		 * 		resource2) { ... }
